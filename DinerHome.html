    <h3>Our Cause</h3>
    <p id="mission">The Ye Olde College Diner, located off of West College Avenue, is in danger of closing after 89 years of operation. Since opening in 1929, The Diner has created some of State College's most iconic treats, "Grilled Stickies." According to owner Dan Rallis, rent has tripled over the past three decades. Rallis has stated that unless somone offters to buy the diner by April 1st, 2018, he plans to close the business. With other iconic institutions having closed in downtown State Collge this past year, such as the popular All-American Rathskeller, we, as residents of State College, have the ability to voice our opinions, and have the power to save this iconic institution from closing. </p>
