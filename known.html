    <h3>What They're Known For</h3>
    <p id="mission">Ye Olde College Diner has been a staple in State College for decades and the primary source of attraction is a delicacy known as Stickies.  Stickies are simply just grilled sticky buns that are typically served with some creamery ice cream.  The staple item on the menu began being served over 30 years ago and quickly became a Penn State tradition, rivaling items such as Beaver Stadium's infamous chicken baskets and the Freshman favorite Pokey Stix.  The Diner produces over 1 million stickies a year, proving the loyalty Penn Stater's have to the traditional local cuisine.  The Diner has been open for since 1929 and took off as a place for Penn State students and State College locals to get a quality meal in 24 hours a day.  Ye Olde College Diner is a landmark in State College and serves as an honorary historic landmark for many alumni whom visit State College each year.</p>
